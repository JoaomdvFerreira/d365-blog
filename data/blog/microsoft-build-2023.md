## Day 1 - Geeking out at the Microsoft Build 2023!

Oh, the joy of being a Dork, right? The opening day of the Microsoft Build 2023 was as shiny as a fresh-out-of-the-box Raspberry Pi. So grab your popcorn (or your IDE, whatever rocks your boat) and let's decode the first day at MBuild!

🧠 **_Microsoft 365 Copilot: The Future of Plugins_**

Generative AI models are the new rockstars of human-machine interactions. MS 365 Copilot, ever the crowd-pleaser, introduced us to its cool new buddies - plugins. They're not just the life of the party; these plugins interact with APIs from other software and services, fetching real-time info, incorporating business data, and doing all kinds of fancy calculations.

## Day 2 - 😲❓🙉❗❗

[Windows 11 Copilot](https://youtu.be/FCfwc-NNo30) - Operating Systems just got changed forever and the watermark is from Microsoft.

Microsoft is giving Windows 11 a fancy new sidekick, the Copilot AI assistant. This smartypants assistant isn't new to the game - we've seen it stealing the show in Edge, Office apps, and even GitHub. Now, Windows 11 is rolling out the red carpet for Copilot, inviting it right into the heart of the action: the taskbar. It's here, there, and everywhere across all apps and programs. Talk about making an entrance! 🚀

"The Windows Copilot side bar is like your trusty companion, hanging out across your apps, programs, and windows, always ready to lend a helping hand," says Panos Panay, Microsoft’s main man for Windows and devices. "It's like a magic wand, transforming every user into a power user. Think of it as your personal genie, helping you pull off wizardry with your settings, and ensuring a smooth ride across your favorite apps." 🧞

Windows Copilot isn't just all talk. It can take content you're viewing in apps and give it a makeover, or even break it down Barney-style. It bears a striking resemblance to the dialog box that's found in Bing Chat, so you can fire away all your questions at it, just like you would to a search engine. 💬

Windows Copilot shares its DNA with Bing Chat, which opens up a world of opportunities for developers. They can now extend plug-ins written for Bing or OpenAI’s ChatGPT to this AI-powered assistant. This means it's all set to take on new functionality that developers are creating for ChatGPT and Bing, and future improvements are a straight highway to Windows Copilot. 🚀

Microsoft has been dropping hints about sprinkling AI magic into Windows for the past six months. Panay even went so far as to claim in January that “AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows.” The tech world was all ears for a major Windows upgrade, but it looks like Microsoft has decided to fast-track its AI dreams. 🎢

Microsoft is now gearing up to test Windows Copilot publicly in June, before sharing the magic with all Windows 11 users.

**Microsoft Mesh**

🌐 Buckle up, gang, because Microsoft Mesh is trying to show Metaverse how to Metaverse! Picture this: You're crafting unique, otherworldly experiences that don't just build bridges, but create teleportation devices, connecting you in ways you've only dreamt about. You're talking 'Avatar' level tech here, with virtual twins and spatial audio that make every interaction feel as warm and fuzzy as a group hug, despite being in different zip codes or continents! 🎧 (I'm probably making it bigger then it actually is. 😊)

Let's get real, we're all a bit over the usual humdrum of the physical world, right? So, why not defy the laws of physics with the power of Mesh? 🚀 Your team can all pile into a shared digital space, creating a sense of togetherness that transcends geographical boundaries. All it takes is a PC, Mac, or even a VR headset (talk about living in the future!), and your squad can all hang out together, wherever they may be.🌍

**Our insights**

- 'Staying in your flow' - Microsoft theme this year - a good looking future for an already gigantic on the tech industry. Fresh and clean cut makes us eager to see what's coming and what actually "stays".
- It feels like everyone is just enjoying developing these tools in Microsoft. Probably one of the main reasons of how this was so amazing to watch.
- All of this nice features and new projects makes us think that Microsoft feels like a newly converted dork that just discovered Visual Studio Code after using notepad++ for decades. They are trying to do everything at once without thinking in the consequences. I know that failing is part of the road but it concerns me that they are just getting ahead of themselves. Besides that we are seeing a new Avengers Team emerging: Microsoft + Github + Nvidia + OpenAi . Wondering who is who on this cast? 🤔
