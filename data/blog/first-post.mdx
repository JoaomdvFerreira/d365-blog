### What is PAC CLI?

Perfect question.

> _PAC CLI is a tool for developers to manage Power Apps and Dynamics 365 projects from the command line. This tool helps developers work more efficiently by automating tasks such as creating and managing solutions, components, and environments._

In practice, it‚Äôs a wrapper for all the manual tasks that we used to be doing in the format of command lines _(you thought you would be a DORK without those, eh?)_. Creating and managing all types of Dynamics 365 components has never been this easy and efficient.

### Stop the nonsense and give me examples!

Wow. Breathe, we've got you covered. Clearly, you are a newbie DORK that ‚ù§Ô∏è _(:loves:)_ action, and that‚Äôs the üëª _(:spirit:)_! Let‚Äôs get you some juice before your üß† _(:brain:)_ runs away.

First things first, the requirements:

- [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en) - install npm during installation;
- Visual Studio Code - [download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ;
- Dynamics 365 trial or environment. Create a 30 days trial [here](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) for free ;
- Azure DevOps Project. Create your repository [here.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/repos) ([Creating an Azure DevOps Repo Helper](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/creatingrepo?view=azure-devops&tabs=visual-studio-2022)) ;
- Power Platform Tools extension in Visual Studio Code - [download here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microsoft-IsvExpTools.PowerPlatformTools#:~:text=Power%20Platform%20Tools%20for%20Visual,endpoints%2C%20webhooks%2C%20and%20more).

Let‚Äôs now go step-by-step for the Power Platform Tools extension so you can follow along.

**Step 1:** Install Power Platform Tools from the Visual Studio Code extension manager tab.

![**Image1** - Extension Manager (hotkey) - VS Code - Install Power Platform Tool](/static/images/blog/post1/Image1.png)

**Step 2:** Check if everything is installed correctly by creating a new terminal on your Visual Studio Code

![**Image2** - Main Bar - VS Code - Create a new terminal (hotkey)](/static/images/blog/post1/Image2.png)

Overwhelming? Probably not, but let‚Äôs clear the fog and focus on these two highlighted commands in the list below:

- Authentication Commands
  - **auth**
    - create
      ```powershell
      pac auth create --url https://org****.crm*.dynamics.com --name DorksOrg
      ```
    - list
      ```powershell
      pac auth list
      ```
    - select
      ```powershell
      pac auth select --index 2
      ```
- Solution Commands
  - **solution**
    - list
      ```powershell
      pac solution list
      ```
    - online-version
    - export
    - unpack

As the first rule in Dork's book says, ‚ÄúBe as practical as possible‚Äù, we are creating a mini-project that is being used in real life _(whatever that is)_. Something that you could implement easily and shine among your team members ü§ì.

**Objective** ‚Üí Add environment changes on development commits to an Azure DevOps repository.

**Why** ‚Üí By including environment changes in code commits, we can ensure that changes are properly documented and tracked, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the development process. Additionally, this approach can help our team identify and resolve issues more quickly, as changes can be traced back to specific code commits. Basically, safeguard that no one comes and bites our üçë (:ass:) after we have clearly created the business logic in the wrong entity!

Trial Environment ‚úÖ (:check:), Azure DevOps Repository ‚úÖ (:check:), Objective ‚úÖ (:check:), Why question ‚úÖ (:check:), major boredom from all the introductions ‚úÖ(:check:). I believe we've got it all covered, so it‚Äôs time to actually begin!

Time for the money shot:

### **Visual Studio Code tasks**

Visual Studio Code tasks are like giving your computer a step-by-step guide on how to complete a specific task, just like making your bed in the morning.

Imagine you're getting ready for the day and you need to make your bed. You have a specific routine you follow: you straighten out the sheets, fluff the pillows, and tuck in the comforter. It's like a mini-challenge that you complete each day to start off on the right foot.

Now, let's say you could create a task for your computer to complete this chore for you. You could tell your computer what steps to take, just like your bed-making routine, and it would take care of the rest.

For example, you could create a task that tells your computer to straighten the sheets, fluff the pillows, and tuck in the comforter using specific keystrokes or commands. This would be like creating a shortcut for your computer to make your bed for you.

So, instead of having to go through each step yourself, you could trigger the task with just a few clicks or keystrokes and let your computer take care of the rest.

You can check more on this [official link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).

On your VS code folder project create a new folder labelled .vscode and create a new JSON file - tasks.json. You should end up with this project tree.

![Image9 - Visual Studio Code - Project Tree](/static/images/blog/post1/Image10.png)

Image9 - Visual Studio Code - Project Tree

In that tasks.json file copy the JSON structure below

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "DORKS.CRM.Webresources",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": ""
    }
  ],
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "solutionVersion",
      "description": "Solution Version for PAC tasks",
      "default": "1.0.0.0",
      "type": "promptString"
    },
    {
      "id": "userPath",
      "description": "User Path for PAC tasks",
      "default": "Insert your path to the repo here.",
      "type": "promptString"
    }
  ]
}
```

Overall this is a shell command labelled DORKS.CRM.Webresources with two inputs: ‚ÄúsolutionVersion‚Äù and ‚ÄúuserPath‚Äù. Those inputs will be prompted whenever we click on the run task

![Image11 - Visual Studio Code Tasks - Run Task](/static/images/blog/post1/Image11.png)

![Image 12 - Visual Studio Code Tasks - Tasks prompt](/static/images/blog/post1/Image12.png)

Image13 - Visual Studio Code Tasks - userPath input

![Image14 - Visual Studio Code Tasks - solutionVersion](/static/images/blog/post1/Image14.png)

Image14 - Visual Studio Code Tasks - solutionVersion

Great! Let‚Äôs break down our command now:

1 - We want to make sure that we are always in the right directory:

```bash
cd '${input:userPath}/DORKS.CRM.Webresources' ;
```

2 - As we are making changes to the solution we need to change its version:

```bash
pac solution online-version --solution-name DorksCRMWebresources --solution-version ${input:solutionVersion} ;
```

3 - Now we export the solution:

```bash
pac solution export --path ${input:userPath}\DORKS.CRM.Webresources --name DorksCRMWebresources --managed false --overwrite true ;
```

_The "--managed" flag is set to false, indicating that the solution is not a managed solution. The "--overwrite" flag is set to true, indicating that any existing solution files with the same name should be overwritten._

4 - And unpack it:

```bash
pac solution unpack --zipfile ${input:userPath}\DORKS.CRM.Webresources\DorksCRMWebresources.zip --packagetype unmanaged --folder ${input:userPath}\DORKS.CRM.Webresources\deploy
```

_The "--packagetype" flag is set to "unmanaged", indicating that the solution is not a managed solution. The "--folder" flag specifies the folder where the solution files should be unpacked to._

Your tasks.json file should look like this:

```
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "DORKS.CRM.Webresources",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cd '${input:userPath}/DORKS.CRM.Webresources' ; pac solution online-version --solution-name DorksCRMWebresources --solution-version ${input:solutionVersion} ; pac solution export --path '${input:userPath}/DORKS.CRM.Webresources' --name DorksCRMWebresources --managed false --overwrite true ; pac solution unpack --zipfile '${input:userPath}/DORKS.CRM.Webresources/DorksCRMWebresources.zip' --packagetype unmanaged --folder '${input:userPath}/DORKS.CRM.Webresources/deploy'"
    }
  ],
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "solutionVersion",
      "description": "Solution Version for PAC tasks",
      "default": "1.0.0.0",
      "type": "promptString"
    },
    {
      "id": "userPath",
      "description": "User Path for PAC tasks",
      "default": "Insert your path to the repo here.",
      "type": "promptString"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, it‚Äôs time to Run the task. Go for it!

You can then tweak the commands as much as you like to suit your [OCD](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/treatment/) needs in terms of the project structure.

Let‚Äôs commit this to our repository now.

Good news and bad news. The good news is that we are almost done! Bad news? Nothing really, just thought it would catch your attention. üòà

The base of our solution is now on our repository, let's see the improvements now by adding the accountjs file to our solution, in our Dynamics 365 Environment, and running the task again.

The entire team will now be able to see the changes that were made to the system. From the solution version to the component being added to the solution to the GUID of the web resource, you will have a full view of what was changed and what should have been changed.

And, what we all deeply desire in the end, is an excuse to go grab a cup of coffee and celebrate this small but important victory. Cheers to making development processes more efficient and organized!

Pff how lame was that‚Ä¶
